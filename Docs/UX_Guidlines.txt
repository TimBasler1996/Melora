# UX Guidelines

SocialSound should feel:
- calm
- premium
- dating-app quality
- music-first

## General principles
- Prioritize readability: key info must be visible at a glance
- Avoid dense list UI; prefer cards and clear hierarchy
- Use breathing room (padding and spacing)
- Use subtle motion only (no flashy animations)
- Avoid "developer UI" look

## Profile
Preview mode:
- emotional and clean
- hero image is NOT round-cropped
- no "now playing" section in profile preview
- Spotify profile is linked via an icon/badge, not text

Edit mode:
- functional Hinge-like editing
- 6 photo slots in a 2x3 grid
- small tiles
- tap to replace, X to remove (soft delete)
- Discard restores local snapshot without reload

## Discover
Feed:
- large cards, but NOT full width (show scroll affordance)
- hero photo is dominant
- show clearly:
  - Name + age
  - Track title (larger)
  - Artist (smaller)
  - City
  - Distance in meters
- sort by distance ascending when possible

Interactions:
- tap card -> detail sheet
- dismiss with X or swipe
- after dismiss ask:
  - not interested in song (mute track)
  - not interested in user (mute user)

Detail sheet:
- top: Spotify-like track header (artwork + title + artist + album)
- actions: like + optional message + send
- bottom: profile snapshot (compact)
